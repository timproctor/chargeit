See the site live at [ChargeIt](http://shielded-depths-8243.herokuapp.com)

ChargeIt is an individual project that makes use of CSV data from data.opencolorado.org and specifically the electrical vehicle charging stations.

This app uses the Google API to map charging stations and to search an address that is provided by the consumer. This is the "skateboard" version of the app. When I get more time, I'd like to deliver the "car" that I set out to deliver.

There is currently an authentication through Twitter, but there is no functionality to this feature except that it paves the way for future functionality at a later date and feature add-ons.
