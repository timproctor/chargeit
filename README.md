This is the beginning of a 3 week project to build a small app that integrates
OpenColorado data and Google's API. Denver drivers will be able to use the app
to find the information on the closest parking structure. Even though this idea
is small in scope, there are additions that could make the app like the Yelp of
parking.

Additional information will be coming soon...
